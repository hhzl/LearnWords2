#
# This file follows the YAML conventions
# http://yaml.org/
# and serves as an "ini" file, a file to set
# parameters.
#
#
# Comment lines start with a hash sign #
#
# Subdirectories for the data processing 
# are assigned in this file.
#
#
# From the command line run
#
#    grunt aTaskName
#
#
# List of available tasks is available through
#
#    grunt --help
#
#
# Prominent commands are
#
#    grunt build
#
#   
#    grunt csv2json
#
# The latter command converts what is in the 'data/csv' directory to 
# 'data/json'. It has to be called before issuing a command like
#
#    grunt odgreport 
#
# or
#
#    grunt htmlspelling
#
#
#
#
# Note for developers:
# --------------------
#
# The main advantage for this file to be in YAML instead of 
# JSON is that comments are possible and no curly brackets have
# to be used.
#
#
# To convert this 'initialisation data' to JSON use
# for example
# https://www.json2yaml.com/convert-yaml-to-json
#
#
# The Grunt task runner processes the content of this file
# with 'readyaml', see
# http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.file#grunt.file.readyaml

# The LearnWords data is taken from
# --------------------------------------------------------------

INPUT_DIR: data

# You may put a hash sign in front of the line above to 
# deactivate that input data is taken from the 'data' directory
# and remove the hash sign below. Then the input data is taken
# from a sibling directory of the project directory called
# 'LW-data-g'. The data directory needs to contain a subdirectory
# 'csv' which should contain word lists.

# INPUT_DIR: ../LW-data-g








# --------------------------------------------------------------
# The directory to put converted data
# for other use, for example a HTML report or a LibreOffice Draw
# export of pictures with labels in the translated language
# of the CSV wor list data in the input directory.
# --------------------------------------------------------------

OUTPUT_DIR: data-export
# OUTPUT_DIR: ../LW-data-export








# --------------------------------------------------------------
# The directory for the GUI demo
# --------------------------------------------------------------

WEB_ROOT: public
BUILD_DIR: public/js






# --------------------------------------------------------------
# The distribution directory for the library LW.js
# --------------------------------------------------------------


DIST_DIR: dist
